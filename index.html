        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstones of web page creations - foundation and structure.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Information in the head element is not visible in the live version of the webpage, except for the title tag.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Utilization of different tags within the body element is essential for information categorization along with aesthetic purposes.</li>
          <li>Visible HTML elements must be contained in between an opening and closing tag.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Margin and padding follow the CSS Box model.</li>
          <li>* selector is a special wild card symbol that applies all rules in the external CSS stylsheet to all elements in the HTML.</li>
          <li>Adding a comma in between two elements in the CSS stylesheet denotes a single rule (DRY - Do not repeat yourself code).</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS stylesheet, and External CSS stylesheet.</li>
          <li>Inline and Internal CSS, are both directly added into the HTML file but are less flexible.</li>
          <li>External CSS stylesheet is the most common way to style due to its better flexibility.</li>

          <li>Github is the webinterface of Git, it is a version control software that allows multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time.</li>
          <li>Repositories are projects in Git. It is a folder for your projects that contains all the files that utilizes revision control to safeguard past and future changes.</li>

          <li>Pull Request(PR) is when you request for changes to be merged into the main branch to reflect on the live site. It is the best time to discuss and review your work with others.</li>
          <li>Merge occurs when a PR is approved and pulled into the main branch. Another term is "Deployment".</li>
          <li>Issues are ways to report new tasks or content fixes. It is mainly used to track progress on the project.</li>
          <li>Content update workflow: Create a branch (CLI - git checkout) > Add commits (CLI - git commit) > Open a Pull Request (CLI - git pull & git push) > Discuss & Review (GitHub - review content changes) > Merge and Deploy (GitHub - Merge to Main branch) </li>
          </li>
        <h3>Git commands</h3>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git clone: creates a local copy of your project to local computer</li>
